 * Convert binary data to and from UrlBase64 encoding.  This is identical to
 * Base64 encoding, except that the padding character is "." and the other 
 * non-alphanumeric characters are "-" and "_" instead of "+" and "/".
 * <p>
 * The purpose of UrlBase64 encoding is to provide a compact encoding of binary
 * data that is safe for use as an URL parameter. Base64 encoding does not
 * produce encoded values that are safe for use in URLs, since "/" can be 
 * interpreted as a path delimiter; "+" is the encoded form of a space; and
 * "=" is used to separate a name from the corresponding value in an URL 
 * parameter.
